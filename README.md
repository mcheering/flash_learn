# Flash_Learn

## Description 
Flash Learn is an educational application for students to make flash cards and quiz themselves to develop better vocabulary. 

## Access
You can access the application [here](https://ancient-dawn-05615.herokuapp.com/auth)

## Use
Going to the website, you will be greeted with this screen 
!["login"](./client/src/images/Home.png)

If you do not have an account, you can click the link at the bottom of the form and you will be taken to a page that looks like this. 
!["signup"](./client/src/images/signup.png)

Once logged in, you will be greeted to a home page.
!["home"](./client/src/images/Home.png)

You can enter information to make a new card, if the topic is the same as one that already exists, you will not see a new topic pop up.  But when you click on a topic card, it will redirect you to a page to quiz yourself.  On this page you can flip cards.  The image below shows the front of a card.
!["front"](./client/src/images/FronCard.png)

Clicking the icon below the term will flip the card over to the back.

## Contributions
I'd like to thank Brandon Max and Paal Williams for their guidance on this project.  They were a huge help to me and teaching more about React js.  

## Future Development
- Keep track of correct and incorrect cards
- Provide users a summary of what they need to study after a session of using flashcards. 
- Sharing flashcards with other users.
- Searching for publicly availble flashcards. 
- .csv file input to ingest flshcards in bulk.  
- Adding images to cards for pictoral representations. 

## Summary
This project was an opportunity to dive into the React framework.  This was difficult at first, but over time I felt like I learned a lot about managing state.
